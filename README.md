📝 Description:
This project analyzes international student migration patterns using network science and data visualization techniques. It involves cleaning and standardizing real-world student mobility data from 50+ countries, constructing a directed weighted network graph, and applying centrality measures and community detection to uncover key hubs and regional clusters. Visualizations include degree-based node mapping over world geography using tools like NetworkX, GeoPandas, and Matplotlib.

✅ Features:
Data preprocessing and cleaning of inbound/outbound student records

Construction of a directed weighted graph from raw CSV

Computation of degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality

Louvain community detection for identifying migration-based clusters

Geospatial visualization of global student flows

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, GeoPandas

NetworkX

Matplotlib, Seaborn

CSV & GeoJSON handling
